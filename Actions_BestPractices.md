# Actions & Power Automate Best Practices Prompt

## GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt

```
Review this Microsoft Copilot Studio action YAML against official best practices from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/advanced-use-flow and action integration guidelines.

Check and improve:
1. Connection reference configuration and security
2. Input/output variable mapping and validation
3. Error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. User communication during action execution
5. Authentication and authorization settings
6. Performance considerations and timeouts
7. Integration with conversation flow
8. YAML structure and action metadata

Focus on official Microsoft recommendations for Power Automate integration, security best practices, and user experience during action execution. Provide corrected YAML if issues found.
