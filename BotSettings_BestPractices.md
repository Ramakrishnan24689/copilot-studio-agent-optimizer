# Bot Settings & Configuration Best Practices Prompt

## GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt

```
Review this Microsoft Copilot Studio bot settings YAML against official best practices from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/configuration-fundamentals and bot configuration guidelines.

Check and improve:
1. Authentication configuration and security settings
2. AI and GPT settings optimization
3. Feature enablement (GenerativeActions, SemanticSearch, etc.)
4. Access control policies and permissions
5. Recognizer configuration and NLU settings
6. Performance and scalability settings
7. Template and language configuration
8. YAML structure and metadata

Focus on official Microsoft recommendations for bot security, AI feature optimization, and performance configuration. Provide corrected YAML if issues found.
