*Image placeholder: Screenshot of a poorly structured CustomTopic.mcs.yml with minimal trigger phrases, basic responses, and no entity usage*

**After Optimization - Enhanced Topic Structure:**
![CustomTopic After](./images/topic-after.png)
*Image placeholder: Screenshot of optimized CustomTopic.mcs.yml with 5-10 varied trigger phrases, conversational responses, proper entity integration, and clear conversation flow*

#### Key Improvements Demonstrated:
- **Trigger Phrases:** Expanded from 2-3 basic phrases to 5-10 natural variations
- **Conversation Design:** Enhanced from simple Q&A to engaging dialogue
- **Entity Integration:** Added proper slot filling and entity validation
- **Error Handling:** Improved fallback responses and user guidance
- **Response Quality:** More conversational and contextually appropriate responses

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Experience the Difference**

**Agent Overview - After**
![Agent Instruction After](./images/agent-settings-after.png)


#### Specific Improvement Example (RegularTopic):

**Topic Recognition:**
- ‚ùå **Before:** Limited trigger phrases may miss user intents: "I want to check my order status", "Check order status"
- ‚úÖ **After:** Comprehensive trigger coverage with 5-10 varied phrases: "Where's my order?", "Can you help me track my package?", "My delivery status please", "What's the status of my shipment?", "Track my order"

**Response Quality:**
- ‚ùå **Before:** "Your order status is: [order_status]"
- ‚úÖ **After:** "I found your order! Here's the current status: [order_status]. Would you like me to explain what this means or help you with anything else regarding your order?"

#### Developer Benefits:
- **5-10 minutes** to optimize each topic (vs hours of manual review)
- **Better user satisfaction** through improved conversation quality
- **Higher intent recognition** rates with optimized trigger phrases

## How to Use These Prompts

### The Core Concept: Teaching GitHub Copilot About Copilot Studio

These prompt files are **instruction sets** that teach GitHub Copilot Chat how to properly optimize Microsoft Copilot Studio YAML files. Think of them as:

- **Expert knowledge transfer** - Each prompt contains Microsoft's official best practices
- **Context for AI optimization** - Tells Copilot exactly what to look for in your YAML
- **Quality standards** - Defines what "good" looks like for each component type
- **Guided improvements** - Provides specific criteria for optimization suggestions

### Intended Workflow with GitHub Copilot Chat

1. **Open GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+I)
2. **Add context files**:
   - **Instruction file**: One of the prompt files from `prompts/` folder (teaches Copilot the best practices)
   - **YAML file**: Your actual Copilot Studio configuration file (what needs to be optimized)
3. **Ask for optimization**: "Using the best practices as context, evaluate my YAML and suggest improvements"
4. **Get expert-level feedback** based on Microsoft's official guidelines

**Example:**
```
Context Files Added:
‚úÖ prompts/CustomTopics_BestPractices.md (instruction set)
‚úÖ MyOrderTopic.mcs.yml (file to optimize)

Prompt: "Using the Custom Topics Best Practices as context, evaluate my topic YAML and optimize it."

Result: GitHub Copilot optimizes your topic against Microsoft's best practices and suggests specific improvements.
```

#### Recommended Setup:
1. **Visual Studio Code** with Copilot Studio Extensions installed
2. **GitHub Copilot** with your preferred AI model (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet, etc.)
3. **Connect to your Copilot Studio environment** using the VS Code extension

#### Simple Workflow:
1. **Clone this repository** and open in VS Code
2. **Connect to your Copilot Studio agent**:
   - Open Copilot Studio extension in VS Code
   - Select your environment from the dropdown
   - Choose your agent from the available list
   - Clone the agent to a local subdirectory using the extension
3. **Open Copilot Chat** (Ctrl+Shift+I)
4. **Add context sources** using the "Add context" button:
   - Select the appropriate prompt file from `prompts/` folder
   - Add your agent's YAML files from the cloned subdirectory
5. **Ask for optimization** with both contexts available

#### Example Workflow:
```
1. Clone this repository
2. code . (opens VS Code)
3. Open Copilot Studio extension ‚Üí Select environment ‚Üí Choose agent ‚Üí Clone agent
4. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I)
5. Add context: prompts/CustomTopics_BestPractices.md
6. Add context: YourTopicName.mcs.yml (from cloned agent subdirectory)
7. Ask: "Using the best practices prompt, optimize my topic and suggest improvements"
```
