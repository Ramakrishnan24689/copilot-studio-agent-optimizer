## GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt

```
Review this Microsoft Copilot Studio trigger configuration YAML against official best practices from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/guidance/trigger-phrases-best-practices and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/guidance/triggering-topics.

Check and improve:
1. Trigger phrase optimization (5-10 varied, natural phrases under 10 words)
2. Intent definition clarity and specificity
3. Topic overlap prevention and disambiguation
4. Natural language understanding effectiveness
5. Priority settings and behavior configuration
6. Include/exclude settings for intent selection
7. YAML structure and trigger configuration

Focus on official Microsoft recommendations for trigger phrase creation, NLU optimization, and topic triggering effectiveness. Provide corrected YAML if issues found.
