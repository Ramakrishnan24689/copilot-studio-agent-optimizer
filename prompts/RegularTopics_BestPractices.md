Review this Microsoft Copilot Studio regular topic YAML against official best practices from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/guidance/topic-authoring-best-practices and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/guidance/trigger-phrases-best-practices.

Check and improve:
1. Trigger phrases optimization (5-10 varied, natural phrases under 10 words)
2. Topic structure and organization (bite-size, reusable)
3. Conversational design and user experience
4. Entity usage and slot filling optimization
5. Variable management and data flow
6. Integration with other topics and system components
7. Question design and response handling
8. YAML structure and formatting

Focus on official Microsoft recommendations for topic authoring, trigger phrases, conversational design, and user experience. Provide corrected YAML if issues found.
