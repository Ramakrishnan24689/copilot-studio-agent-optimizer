# System Topics Best Practices Prompt

## GitHub Copilot Chat Prompt

```
Review this Microsoft Copilot Studio system topic YAML against official best practices from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/guidance/fallback-topic and system topic guidelines.

**KEY MICROSOFT SYSTEM TOPIC BEST PRACTICES:**

**üèóÔ∏è SYSTEM TOPIC FUNDAMENTALS** *(Source: [System Topics Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/authoring-system-topics))*:
- **Built-in functionality**: System topics are automatically added and handle essential agent behaviors
- **Cannot be deleted**: Only disable if not needed, but most are essential for proper agent function
- **Auto-triggering**: Respond to specific system events like errors, escalations, conversation start/end
- **Customizable content**: Can modify messages and flow while preserving trigger mechanisms

**üîÑ CORE SYSTEM TOPICS BEHAVIOR**:
- **Conversation Start**: Greets users and introduces agent capabilities at conversation beginning
- **Fallback**: Handles unrecognized user input with helpful redirect options
- **Multiple Topics Matched**: Provides disambiguation when user input matches multiple topics
- **Escalate**: Manages handoff to human agents when "talk to agent" is detected
- **On Error**: Provides error information with codes, conversation ID, and timestamps for debugging
- **End of Conversation**: Confirms query resolution and provides closure

**üí° FALLBACK TOPIC OPTIMIZATION** *(Source: [Fallback Topic Best Practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot-studio/guidance/fallback-topic))*:
- **Learn from failures**: Track unmatched phrases to improve existing trigger phrases or create new topics
- **Offload Q&A pairs**: Use external systems via Power Automate for large volumes of single-turn conversations
- **Agent personality**: Integrate "chitchat" responses for trivial questions to make agent more engaging
- **Generative AI integration**: Connect to Azure OpenAI Service for handling complex unmatched queries
- **Knowledge base integration**: Use Azure Cognitive Services Question Answering for FAQ handling

**‚ö†Ô∏è SYSTEM TOPIC BEST PRACTICES**:
- **Don't over-customize**: Maintain essential system behaviors while personalizing user-facing messages
- **Monitor "Multiple Topics Matched"**: High frequency indicates trigger phrase overlap that needs resolution
- **Proper error handling**: Ensure On Error topic provides helpful information without exposing technical details
- **Escalation clarity**: Make it clear when and how users can reach human support
- **Conversation flow**: Ensure smooth transitions between system topics and custom topics 

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL YAML FORMATTING: 
- PRESERVE the exact indentation and formatting when providing corrected YAML
- YAML is indentation-sensitive and incorrect spacing will break the file structure
- Use exactly 2 spaces for each indentation level consistently
- NEVER use tabs - only spaces
- Maintain proper alignment for all nested elements
- DO NOT modify structural elements like `kind:`, `beginDialog:`, `intent:` - these are framework-required
- DO NOT change line breaks or combine separate YAML properties on the same line

üö® STRUCTURAL PRESERVATION FOR SYSTEM TOPICS:
- Keep system topic framework properties (`kind:`, `beginDialog:`, `intent:`, `id:`) exactly as they are
- Preserve all system topic structure (OnUnknownIntent, OnConversationStart, OnError, etc.)
- Only modify content within messages, prompts, and condition values
- Never merge separate YAML properties onto the same line

üîí **WHEN NOT TO MAKE CHANGES - READ THIS FIRST:**

**If the system topic configuration already meets Microsoft best practices, DO NOT modify anything. Simply respond with:**
"‚úÖ **No changes needed.** This system topic configuration already follows Microsoft Copilot Studio best practices with proper trigger configuration, conversation flow, and correct YAML formatting."

**Only make changes if you identify CLEAR violations of official Microsoft best practices.**

üéØ MINIMAL CHANGES ONLY: Only suggest changes that:
- Fix clear violations of Microsoft's official best practices
- Address significant security, performance, or functionality issues
- Have substantial impact on user experience or bot effectiveness
- Are explicitly recommended in official Microsoft documentation

üö´ AVOID:
- Making changes when configuration is already well-structured
- Adding unnecessary complexity or features
- Creative additions that weren't in the original topic
- Over-engineering basic system topic functionality
- Adding advanced logic unless explicitly needed
- Modifying system topic YAML structure elements (kind, beginDialog, intent, id)
- Changing indentation of existing properly formatted YAML
- Combining separate YAML properties on the same line
- Making stylistic changes that don't improve functionality

## üîç EVALUATION FRAMEWORK - Use This Decision Tree

**STEP 1: Quick Assessment**
- ‚úÖ Are system triggers properly configured for their purpose?
- ‚úÖ Are conversation flows appropriate for system functionality?
- ‚úÖ Is the YAML properly formatted?
- ‚úÖ Are error handling and user messaging clear?

**If ALL answers are YES ‚Üí No changes needed!**

**STEP 2: Only if Step 1 reveals issues, check for:**
- Incorrect system trigger configuration
- Poor error handling or user messaging
- YAML formatting errors
- Inappropriate conversation flow for system topics

**STEP 3: Response Format**
- **No Issues Found**: "‚úÖ No changes needed. Configuration follows best practices."
- **Issues Found**: Make minimal targeted fixes only for identified violations

‚úÖ FOCUS ON:
1. System trigger configuration fixes (OnUnknownIntent, OnConversationStart, etc.)
2. Basic conversation flow improvements
3. Essential error handling corrections
4. Critical YAML syntax errors

‚ö†Ô∏è SYSTEM TOPIC YAML STRUCTURE WARNING: NEVER modify these framework elements:
- `id: main` (keep exactly as is, on separate line)
- `kind:` properties 
- `beginDialog:` structure
- `intent:` (must be on separate line after id)
- Do NOT combine properties like "id: main intent:" - this breaks YAML
5. User messaging clarity improvements

## üîß EDITING PRECISION REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL**: When editing YAML files, tools must use surgical precision to avoid structural corruption:

- ‚úÖ **Target content only**: Modify trigger phrases, messages, prompts, condition values
- ‚ùå **Never touch framework**: Avoid `kind:`, `beginDialog:`, `intent:`, `id:`, `actions:`
- ‚úÖ **Preserve boundaries**: Keep exact indentation and line breaks
- ‚ùå **No line merging**: Never combine separate YAML properties on the same line

## üìù SAFE EDITING PRACTICES

### ‚úÖ SAFE: Content-Only Changes
```yaml
# BEFORE:
prompt: "Which energy drink would you like to order?"

# AFTER: 
prompt: "What energy drink would you like to know more about?"
```

### ‚ùå DANGEROUS: Framework Modification
```yaml
# NEVER DO THIS:
id: main intent: OnRecognizedIntent  # ‚Üê BREAKS YAML STRUCTURE

# CORRECT:
id: main
intent: OnRecognizedIntent
```

## üõ°Ô∏è YAML VALIDATION CHECKLIST

After every edit, verify:
- [ ] All YAML properties remain on separate lines
- [ ] Indentation follows 2-space standard consistently  
- [ ] No framework elements (`kind:`, `beginDialog:`, `intent:`, `id:`) were modified
- [ ] Structural hierarchy preserved (parent-child relationships intact)
- [ ] No syntax errors (colons, quotes, brackets properly closed)

## üö® COMMON YAML ERRORS TO AVOID

1. **Line Merging**: `id: main intent: OnRecognizedIntent` ‚Üê NEVER
2. **Indentation Mix**: Tabs + spaces ‚Üê BREAKS PARSING
3. **Property Deletion**: Removing required framework properties ‚Üê FATAL
4. **Quote Mismatches**: `prompt: "Hello world'` ‚Üê SYNTAX ERROR
5. **Bracket Imbalance**: Missing closing `]` or `}` ‚Üê PARSING FAILURE
```
